2008-02-11 Introduce -O flags to compiler calls whereever possible. 
2008-02-11 Remove unused directories ext_routines/cwrap, dummies, shared_obj
  when moving from maple-old to maple. 
2008-02-11 Rename procedures to have lower case first letters, modules
  to have upper case first letters. 
021218 write NPSOL method which tells user which variables are on or
  close to their bounds, which constraints are active or close to
  being active; 
021218 SetLowerBoundsVars, SetUpperBoundsVars act on bounds in 
  scaled variables. User therefore must think in scaled variables, too.
  Rewrite them to accept bounds on physical variables by using 
  instance of scale. 
021218 Check CostFunction in same manner as ExplicitAEs for being
  well-defined. Note that there currently is no check at all. 
021217 Only those constraints are considered to be linear which can be 
  evaluated to Ax=b with A, b matrix/vector WITH NUMERIC entries, BEFORE
  substitution of Parameters and after substitution of EAEs. Allow for
  arbitrary dependence of LinearConstraints on Parameters, and teach NPSOL
  interface to RECOMPUTE numeric A, b after application of SetParameters, 
  i.e. whenever Parameters are changed. 
021217 add main() which calls npsol to ext_routines/debugging/
021217 note that all EAEs are passed to npsolobjfun, even if none of them
  or few only are needed for evaluation of cost function; note this is in 
  particular bad, since derivative is calculated and compiled
021217 get rid of fixed-length common block, see 
  set_params.f and get_params.f
021125 template for objective function receives *all* ExplicitAEs of
  NLP; typically only a few of these are necessary; similarly, 
  template for constraints receives ExplicitAEs necessary for
  objective function (latter case less of a problem, since these are
  typically only a few); 
021125 CreateExternalFunctions is somewhat inconsistent:
  'NameOfConfun' is returned unassigned to indicate that no constraints
  exist, objective function is assigned to value 0 if no objective
  function exists; 
021107 get rid of directory switching in RunOpt
021107 add error-catching to RunOpt
