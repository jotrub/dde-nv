When xmaple has crashed, then sometimes the following error occurs:
ddaskp: call_external lower dimensions of ARRAY does not match (4709098098929, expected 1).

I can't reproduce this error. It appears after maple has been forced to stop (killed or crashed).

Remove files written after CreateInstance has been called from home directory, seems to work. I do not understand
why those files are there anyway, since I specify a folder in the working directory, that should
contain those files.

Also starting xmaple directly from the WorkingDir folder.

But I couldn't verify any of these tricks, since the error has not occured anymore and could not be
reproduced.

Maybe in the directory maple is called, there are some hidden files, that need to be removed.

Restarting the system, didn't work.
