To run the gui interface start codeGenGUI.m, make sure that the folders (with subfolders) gui and 
codegen are in the matlab searchpath.

The GUI will ask you to enter the systems properties.
Then it will generate the code for maple and compile it (to c-files).
Then the c-files will be modified and compiled to mex-files.
